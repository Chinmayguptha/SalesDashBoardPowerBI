This project is a practice-based Sales Dashboard created using Microsoft Power BI to understand data visualization and business insights. The dashboard presents key sales metrics such as total sales, revenue trends, regional performance, and product-wise analysis using interactive charts and filters.

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience in data cleaning, basic modeling, and visual storytelling, while learning how raw sales data can be transformed into meaningful insights for decision-making. It helped me understand how dashboards are used in real business scenarios to track performance and identify trends.
